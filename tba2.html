For any number of reasons, you and your team may find yourself at a week 1 event this season, but there are a few ways to make sure you kick butt instead of your butt getting kicked by it.
<h3>Step 0: Finish your robot in build season.</h3>
We've got less than a week to go, but the surefire way to do well in Week 0 is to not be building your robot at the event.  From mechanisms that have been given the tried and true test of "break it 'til you make it" and code that always work right, auto routines that have been perfected, you're not done until the robot is ready for anything you can throw at it... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVVCRmXdiE">or throw at your kids</a>.  If it's too late for that though, there are still plenty of steps you can take.
<h3>Step 1:  Watch Week 0 & .5s</h3>
Given the way that the season this year falls, there are actually events <em>before</em> the first week of competition, being Week 0 (the official pre-season event) and the <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018scmb">Palmetto Regional</a> (Week .5, starting in the middle of the week).  By watching these events, teams will be able to see the ups and downs of <em>FIRST</em> Power Up and can try to do their best given what they see.  It also gives scouting teams a chance to practice their systems, and work out some last minute bugs.
<h3>Step 2: Unbag Time</h3>
If you're a district team, congratulations!  You get 6 hours of unfiltered time in your own shop <em>after bag</em> to work on your robot (<a href="https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2018/Manual/2018FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf#page=72">as per R20</a>).  This absolutely invaluable time can be used to rapidly change a broken part in the time between Bag Day and your Unbag time, iterate a design, swap out for a finished part, etc.  Plenty of teams have <a href="https://blog.thebluealliance.com/2017/01/02/behind-the-design-frc-558-2016-what-withholding-allowance/">used </a>this plenty of times before, so if it's legal to gain a competitive edge... why not?
<h3>Step 3: More checklists than teams at your event.</h3>
For every mistake a team makes, there are practices that can be followed better.  "Why did we lose that match?  Oh, we forgot to check the battery."  Make a checklist, stick to it.  If you find another step you need to add, do so.  A pre-match and post-match checklist can save a match, which can mean the difference between Alliance Captain and going unpicked.

In addition, event packing / unpacking checklists can make sure everything you need are there. Don't forget your spare parts, your battery beak, <em>your driver station</em>, or anything else at home, whether your event is 2 hours away or 20.  Besides, if it wasn't a good idea they <a href="https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2018/Manual/2018FRCInspectionChecklist.pdf">wouldn't have Robot Inspectors use them. </a>
<h3>Step 4: Practice Matches</h3>
Even if your team made liberal use of their build season, crammed in as much practice time as possible, it's pretty likely you still didn't have a chance to test with six other robots for this year's game before Bag.  If your robot is otherwise mostly functional, this is an invaluable time to gain real field experience without it hurting your ranking.  Use it to the best of your ability.
<h3>Step 5: Bumpers</h3>
Those things that protect your robot?  Yeah they're not up to par, I almost guarantee.  They can be re-tightened, gone down the bumper rules in the manual, polished, check to be mounted, etc.  If you're one of the many teams who can build mechanically incredible robots but can't assemble bumpers, then <a href="https://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/papers/3437">this recent guide</a> might be of help.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
To sum it all up:  Despite all the issues teams are undoubtedly going to face at Week 1 events, due to being where a lot of the kinks of the season are worked out, teams are more than capable of taking advantage of this and doing well.  Taking precautions, planning ahead, and using absolutely every resource made available to do well.

Good luck to all teams competing at Week 1 & Week .5 events, and have fun to teams competing at the Week 0!
