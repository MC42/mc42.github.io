<p>It was an uneasy truce between the wind and the cold that let her climb as high as she had. The gate had been dead for years, that’s why she liked it. It let her see everything that was alive for miles, but mostly it let her get away. With a huff, she pulled the scarf tighter and began to climb down, her red gloves a dim brown in the setting sun of the day.</p>
<p><em>The lights haven’t turned on yet.</em> she thought, pausing with each laborful step and hop down off the superstructure. Turns out, climbing to the top of an interdimensional portal exhausts you pretty well. Therefore, it became her normal excercise. Walking all over one’s past, especially when it’s dead, inspires a self of poetic, literary bullshit. Or something, Olivia hadn’t read much lately. As she leapt off of the last hunk of ice next to the gateway, she began the walk back into town. Bit by bit the halogen and sodium vapor lamps all over town began to sputter to light, pockets of color igniting in the night against the gloom of the night, and like a candle in the wind, Olivia felt a flicker of happiness, before being overwhelmed by melancholy, same as everything else.</p>
<p>She ducked and dodged the snowballs from the other residents as she made her way back to the down, knocking on the worn door next to the garage door for larger projects before Lumi lets her in. “Took you long enough, enjoy your walk?” they chided. “Eh, a bit. Got too dark too fast.” she responded with a slight shrug. “Well, that’s what you get for living north of the arctic circle, get in before all the heat runs out”, before ducking through the door and slamming it shut, the old door creaking on it’s hinges. As the door bangs shut, the acoustics of their shared workshop momentarily let the door overpower their music.</p>
<p>“I’ve been gone for four hours and it seems like <em>nothing</em> has improved on your project…” Olivia thought aloud. Lumi flipped up the welding hood for a moment to argue. “Not exactly! I’ve spent the past four hours… failing in new and inventive ways.” “It looks to me like you’ve welded scrap bits of steel to the floor….” “Ah shoot, thank you…” they sputtered, before reaching for the angle grinder strewn across the floor. Olivia snickered a little to herself as Lumi tripped across the floor a bit when going for the angle grinder, before excusing herself to her little corner of the world. She pushed past the red painted door, trying to avoid the rust spots in the area she didn’t paint when she first put it up all those years ago.</p>
<p>She kicks off her boots and unhooks her overalls, just kept company by the rattle of the radiator. She winced a bit as it takes too long to settle, worried Lumi would have to fix the piping… <em>again</em>, before it quieted down and she relaxed again. She slipped her overalls off and tossed them to the seat in her room, hopping up off the small pad she had beneath her hammock as it swung and she nestled in… <em>Ah crap.</em> she thought, nearly falling out of bed. She’d forgotten her meds <em>again</em>. She hopped down out of the hammock and reached as far as she could on the mat for the bottle on her desk before stumbling and feeling the cold concrete floor beneath her toes and yelping quietly.</p>
<p>She takes the top of the container’s top off with her red chipped nails, as she thinks to herself she has to repaint them soon, and downs the little mint-colored pill and it’s pair down with some water, settling back into her hammock, hopping back up with a little less grace than the first time; clearly annoyed she does her best to relax as the gentle rocking sends her to sleep, and for the first time in a long while, her dreams were dreadful.</p>
<p>As she rocked back and forth in her hammock, her memories danced on the back of her eyelids, reliving her first hours in The Wastes. The searching in the bitter cold, her loose summer shirt offering no protection as the cold gripped her body, as she screamed for help, hoarse and miserable inside and out. A shimmering darkness appeared in the white haze as she stumbled towards it, reach for it and as she grabs it, she abruptly falls out of her hammock in an awful clatter.</p>
<hr />
<p>“<em>Fuck!</em>” she yells, as she rubs her head and Lumi bursts through her door in PJs and a croptop wielding an angle grinder like a gun. “are you okay, what’s going on!?” they yell. “Lumi, lumi, I’m fine… fuck. Just fell out of bed.” she muttered, rubbing her head. “oh…” Lumi whimpered, almost disappointed. “Do you want breakfast? I was going to run over to Clarabelle’s and pick up some ham and egg sandwiches.” they ask, extending a hand and putting the angle grinder on the floor gingerly. She grabbed their hand and they pulled her up as well as they could. “Only if you use a clean blowtorch this time, i’m tired of my eggs tasting like I was using asphalt as a utensil.” “FINE! but only because you asked nicely!” they yelled, grabbing the grinder and walking out as Olivia’s door slammed back and forth a bit before settling. She glanced at her pills and took another round before throwing on fuzzy socks, slippers, and a warm pink sweater before heading out to the common room to clean up the mess Lumi <em>definitely</em> didn’t clean up before leaving.</p>
<p>She shoved the angle grinder into the cabinet again, put the welder back in the spot Lumi marked off for it many months ago, despite them <em>never</em> seeming to put it back. The chaotic disorganization made Olivia feel at home, she’d admit, but she still wanted to not inhale the broken angle grinder discs or stir her tea with filler rod. She took the cardboard Lumi had been scrawling across in notes and markers and tried to sort them into piles of “not been touched in a while” and “if I touch them they’ll rip my hand off and shove it into their next robot body for weight”. After a few hours of cleaning, Lumi burst through the outer door, bags all over their arms and snow covering their white hair, making it look even fuzzier, or maybe, just like a human popsicle. <em>When was the last time I had a popsicle…</em> Olivia thought to herself, as Lumi yelled “give me a hand damnit!” laughing a bit as a bag fell off.</p>
<p>“Oops sorry one sec!” she said, rushing to their aid, as they dragged the bags to the center of the table. “Just eggs and ham, sure…” “Hey! In my defense Ms. Crevoiserat was very kind when her computer was having issues and I uhm… fixed it for her?” “How do you say her name right every. single. time!” went Olivia, prodding at Lumi’s side with a smile. “What, it’s just Crevoiserat.” “Cruh vach ser at.” “You’ll get there…” Lumi lamented, patting her on the head, to which was met with a justified stomping off on Olivia’s part. “Hey come back, I’m just back to get started!” they yelled, but Olivia was already into the loft.</p>
<p>She paced around a bit, her slippered feet not doing much to dramatically stomp against the floor, but that didn’t stop her one bit from trying… “Ugh, don’t get upset, it’s okay. You’ll figure it out, words are hard anyways! Plus, she still likes being calledd Clarabelle so it’s not even that bad!” As she paced back and forth, the small plant in the window slowly began to follow her back and forth as she paced, before she noticed the stem twitching to mirror her path and gasped quietly. “Shit, you really <em>really</em> have to stop that…” she muttered, before closing her eyes and taking a deep breath and the plant shrunk down a bit. As she climbed down the ladder, she didn’t notice her eyes were a little more hazel than brown.</p>
<p>“Lumi, did you actually cook breakfast or did you get back to your projects.” she yelled down the ladder as she climbed down gingerly, trying not to let her slippers fall off. “I just cooked yours, it’s on the table.” they piped inbetween wrench turns. “Wait, Liv, come here a sec.” they said, looking up at her about to sit down for food. “What Lumi, did you break another ratch-” she started, before Lumi put their finger on her lips. “Your eyes, what did you do to your eyes?” “What, nothing, they’ve always been this color.” “Last time your eyes looked like that was… nevermind.” “What are you on about…” she said, before wandering over to a mirror and glancing at her face. Same jawbone, same cheeks, same hair, same everything, and she walked back to Lumi. “I look <em>exactly</em> as shitty as I did yesterday, what are you <em>talking</em> about…” she said, while Lumi’s face was awash with confusion. “They were more… what the…. they were a little…. nevermind…” they trailed off muttering, before getting back to the latest contraption of their construction.</p>
<p>Olivia sat at the table slowly chewing on her eggs and putting bits of ham onto her fork as Lumi worked before they interjected. “Oh by the way, a few friends are throwing a party later, if you wanna get out of the shop for a bit and not just be totally isolated in here later.” “Oh that sounds nice, anyone I know gonna be there?”Well yours truly, Julian will be there too. Uhm…. some more builder type folk… OH THE RACE!" they yelled, jumping off the floor and nearly hitting their head on a beam.</p>
<p>“The race, what, like cars?” “Nah Liv, the hoverbike race of all hoverbike races. Salt mine track, few dozen miles, first person for all the racers, plus all the food and drink you want.” “This sounds illegal…” she muttered. “So are a lot of good things, c’mon. It’ll be fun! I promise the really bad stuff will be nowhere you can be associated with it.” “Lumi…..” “Okay, it’s literally just drugs, and the not harmful ones. Plus hormones. Why do you think Julian is gonna be there otherwise…” “True, if Julian is there it can’t be that bad. I’ll think about it…” “Just let me know before I leave, should be a bit. Gives you a chance to find something you like to wear.” She finished her meal with a clatter, tossing the utensils at the sink and the plate too. Turns out, it’s a bit more durable to use stainless steel than ceramics, given both of them having… moments. With that, she was back to her room to find an outfit.</p>
