<h1>Speedrunning & FRC </h1>

<hr>

<p>In the world of videogames, a niche subgenre exists called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun">“speedrunning”</a>.  People attempt to complete the game as fast as they possibly can, meeting criteria as outlined by the community.  Some are common, like Any% (get to the credits), or 100% (finish every objective the game outlines), others more domain specific, like TAS.  This entire community has more in common with competition robotics than most folks realize, so let’s go over the processes of speedrunning.</p>

<p>Speedrunning is the process of procedurally mapping, routing, and playing a game as efficiently as possible.  In FRC we call this process “strategic design”.  We describe the field we play on (mapping) and the ways we can move, the rules (category of the run), the choices we can make (playing the game.)   Some categories (strategies) lend themselves to ignore parts of the game, while others require you to be well rounded and accomplish part of the entire game before you can finish it.</p>

<p>In competition robotics, you outline strategies for a match with your partners, and sometimes things don’t go according to plan.  Your robot can break, or your partners malfunction.  How you react to deviation in plan is a skill essential to the best drive teams in FRC.  In speedrunning, it’s called route correction.  If the game fails to log your input correctly, or you mess up an input, or the game glitches and keeps you in an area, you have to adjust.</p>

<p>FRC games also generally consist of repeatable segments that need to be perfected.  Sometimes it’s scoring in a goal, or moving about the field.  This process in speedrunning is “min-maxing”.  You maximize the tasks done with minimal time.  Positioning your robot to place a gear, or put a boulder into the tower is a min-maxable strategy.  Even more aligned with speedrunning, it can be improved by organic exposure (playing the game over and over for fun) or through training (speedrunning more seriously.)</p>

<p>Over the lifespan of a game, the meta can improve. The types of robots you need, how you play them in autonomous and the various periods of the match.  This can be shown by the evolution of autonomous routines in the 2018 FRC game, or how holonomic movement was an advantage in 2017 for <i>some</i> teams, but not others.  This reflects the evolution of speedrunning route development; the game times are reduced as new, more effective routes are found.</p>

<p>Sometimes, a team finds something so impressive, it breaks the evolution of game strategy.  The terminology around the switch plane break, and using floppy, extensible mechanisms to “fling” cubes sideways as you drive by is analogous to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hUIp3eUyKI">Barrier Skip</a> in The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.  It makes things so much easier, allowing you to ignore a LARGE portion of the game.  This type of approach may not get teams to Einstein, but it can allow the game to evolve quicker, enabling higher level play earlier on</p>

<p><b>In short:</b> competitively trying to beat videogames quickly evolves similarly to the field of competition robotics’ game strategy, and with good reason.  Both are about competing a game as quickly and as perfectly as possible.  </p>
